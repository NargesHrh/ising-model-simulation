# 2D Ising Model Simulation

This project simulates a 2-dimensional Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm and mean-field theory. It produces visualizations of the model's configuration at various time steps.

## Features
- Local interaction using the Metropolis algorithm
- Non-local interaction using mean-field theory
- Saves snapshots of lattice configurations as `.png` files in a `plots` directory

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy and Matplotlib libraries

## Usage
Run the simulation:
```bash
python ising_model.py
